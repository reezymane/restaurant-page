# restaurant-page

Welcome to Soufside Rell's!

This is a restaurant page mock-up. This page was put together using multiple files. Each tab is created with a function
in a module, and these modules are exported from their files and imported into index.js, where they are ran. All images are kept inside the src folder
and imported into the files. While coding, webpack was used improve workflow by seeing changes while they're being made.
